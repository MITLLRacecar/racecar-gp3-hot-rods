All of us pushed an all nighter for this. Thanks for a great month everyone ♥️ 

## Watch

You can watch a video of the playthrough here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQFt_Yp8H8M&ab_channel=DanielChuang

## Usage

- `grand_prix_fast.py` runs our record time code for the GP (opting to use line following for certain segments as it is faster)

- `grand_prix.py` runs our code with each module segments as intented, but produces a slower time

Run `racecar sim grand_prix.py` with the [Simulator Environment](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/Simulation) open to run the code. 

## Structure

Each Python module inside `labs/grand_prix` contains the code for a particular segment of the track. 

`grand_prix.py` and `grand_prix_fast.py` pass the Racecar object to each of these modules as they detect AR Markers along the course. The file mappings are stored inside a `dict` mapped to an `IntEnum` for AR detection in both Grand Prix files
